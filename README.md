# QGA-Implementation

In this project I have tried implement the qunantum genetic algorithm suggested by Yang, Wang, & Jiao (2004) and Wang et al. (2013) in Microsoft Q#. However, their algrithm cannot be implemented in a an actual quantum environment because it need to access amplitudes of Qubits and needs to measure them to evaluate. Therefore, following program does not converge.
